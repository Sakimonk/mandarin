Create help page that gives general description for each of the plots?

1. PCA all data:
Horizontal axis represents PCA1 while vertical axis represents PCA2 of the data. Each data point has been identified to the original group in the data that it came from. PCA helps to show how a partcular individual is positioned in  2D projection. 

2. HC all data:
The vertical axis represents the distance or disimilarity between clusters while the horizontal axis represents objects or clusters.The color scheme represents the diffrent clusters in the data.

3.Uninfected vs Hendra_8hr:
The vertical axis represents  â€“ log10(p-values) while the horizontal axis represents the fold-change values for all genes in the data set.The horizontal axis indicate biologcal impact of the fold change, while the second indicates the reliability or statistical significance of that change. The upper corners of the plot represent genes that have both statistical significance and large fold changes.

4.Uninfected vs Hendra_24hr:

5.Hendra_8hr vs Hendra_24hr:

6.Heatmap:
Each row that represents a gene and each column represents a sample.The colour and intensity of the boxes represents changes in the gene expression. The color scheme represents up-regulated genes, down-regulated genes and  unchanged epression.

7.PCA topgenes:

8.HC topgenes:
