Web design and development

Functionality of the HTML documents:

Each of the HTML document contain navigation menu that allows the user to easily navigate within the same website. It also contain hyperlinks to other external web pages such as DeNTAS GitHub repository that contain all the files associated with the software..

Index.html: the index page welcomes the user and contain ‘GET STARTED’ button that takes the user to the next html page.
About.html:the about page contains short paragraph describing the project mission. 
Choose_uploads.html: the choose uploads page allows the user to input the experimental groups as follows:Uninfected (required), Hendra_8hr(required),Hendra_24hr(required) and optional. The user then can browse the files and upload them successfully. 
Upload.html: uses a python for loop to fill a form with the name of the samples and a dropdown box allowing the user to select their experimental group. The information from this form is then requested by Flask and fed into the data analysis
Results.html: the results pages display the R graphics generated by the R analysis and table showing all significantly expressed genes generated by the BLAST analysis.

HyperText Mark-up Language (HTML)  
HTML is the main markup language for describing the structure of web pages. It is easy to use and share information over the Internet. HTML uses tags that characterize text elements and this serves as an instruction for the web browsers on how the document should appear. In the development of DeNTAS the HTML documents were written and edited using both Adobe Dreamweaver CC and standard text editor. Adobe Dreamweaver CC is flexible web design and development tool for creating user-friendly websites.It is used from front end developers and designers across the world to balance and manage web applications. What makes it unique and easy to use is its visual aids, auto-indentation, code coloring and resizable fonts that reduce errors and make the code readable. In addition, standard text editor is used as this an efficient way to optimize the code accuracy. The HTML documents contain elements consisting of markup tags. Every tag is composed of angle brackets such as <html>, <head>, <body> etc. For each opening tag there is a corresponding closing tag that tell the web browser the completion of a command. For instance <html> and </html> tags. The slash (/) in the closing tag indicates the command is completed. The <!DOCTYPE> indicates the version of the HTML used in the documents. In between headings, text paragraphs, images can be added. External links to other web pages,Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript are implemented in the HTML documents. See Appendix 1 for full explanation of the different tags (Duckett, 2011).

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
CSS is concerned with the representation of the web pages It is implemented in the HTML documents; all fonts, background images,sizes and colors.The CSS code is contained within the <style> tags in the HTML documents. Web browsers use this information when opening HTML documents.CSS makes the documents much easier to maintain and give much better control over the layout of the web pages. The same CSS code can be applied across multiple web pages and that adds more flexibility. This makes it easier to maintain and keeps the consistency across multiple documents. Also, CSS reduces the complexity and that results in faster loading speed.It has wider capabilities in comparison to the HTML elements (Duckett, 2011).
JavaScript
Also, JavaScript alert popup box is generated to display information to the user about the R graphics output. To generate JavaScript alert popup box, alert() function was introduced within the <script> tags and short paragraph describing each graph is written within the empty brackets. Corresponding </script> tag is introduced telling the web browser that the command is completed (Duckett, 2011).
Web standards and compatibility

An HTML document could be created both correctly and incorrectly. Web browsers have the ability to deal with small mistakes and cover errors in the HTML code, therefore it is important to follow the HTML standards correctly and test the page on different browsers.  World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) offers validation service that allows checking whether or not the created HTML page follows the standards. This service can be found at validator.w3.org it gives the user to validate the file by URL checking, uploading the file or pasting some of the HTML code (Cederholm, 2004). 
Limitations and opportunities for future development
One of the main limitations of web design is the display resolution and web browsers implementation and support of HTML standards. Another important thing to consider is the user’s monitor resolution and color settings that will be used to view the web site. Moreover, what browser is being used as a viewpoint and the different setups of web browsers.  
Multiple users - use set of database tables as each table includes ‘user’ column which maps each row to corresponding user account. 
Taking the website online - create customized short URL that can be accessed anywhere in the world.
Loading pages - use JQuery and CSS to create loading icon while page is loading.
Increasing the user options - different species/group numbers
User login features and emailing results - create user login using JavaScript for validating login form that includes two input fields such as username and password.
Further analysis in R? Gene ontology - carry out enrichment analysis in R, perhaps use topGO package that provides tools for testing gene ontology (GO) terms.

Appendix 1. HMTL tags and formatting
Commonly used <head> tags:
<title> Defines the title of the webpage.
<meta> Defines any metadata used to specify page description.
<style> Defines the style of the webpage in accordance with CSS stylesheet.
<link> Links  with external resources.
<script> Introduces JavaScript code or link to external JavaScript file.
Commonly used <body> tags:
<a> Links with different pages within the website but also to other external websites.
<br /> Defines a line break.
<div> Defines a section.
<footer> Defines copyright information.
<form> Defines user input such as test field and many more.
<h1> to <h6> Defines a number of heading level.
<header> Defines container with introductory content. 
<img /> Introduces images to the webpages, src indicates filenames and its position and alt indicates the name of the image.
<input> Defines a field that allows the user to enter data.
<ol>  Defines a ‘list term’ <li>
<p> Defines a paragraph of text.
<select> Defines a list of options <option>
<strong> Defines important text.
<tbody> Defines a table.
<td> Defines a normal table column.
<! -- -- > Add comments.

Appendix 2. CSS tags and formatting

font- family-specifies the font for an element.
background-image-sets background image for an element.
